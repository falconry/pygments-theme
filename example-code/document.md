## Heading two

Not much to see here.

Except some ~~deleted text~~ using the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)

## Python code example

This is a simple Python code example:
```python
class MyClass:
    "An uncomplicated class."

    def __init__(self):
        pass
```

### Heading three
That's it.
